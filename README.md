# Machine Learning Techniques Application for Installation Torque Prediction of Helical Piles

- What the project does:

This project is an application of Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting torque in helical piles. 
This project uses a database with torque observations in the installation of helical piles used as a foundation in an infrastructure construction for power transmission towers.
In this way, this database trains ML models for torque prediction.

- Some informations:

This project is in the form of a manuscript, all the text, methodology, results and figures can be found here!

The main executable file is: **Manuscript_github.Rmd**

The main database used is the file: **Bruto.csv**

- How users can start using the project:

1. Download all these files to a folder on your computer  :open_file_folder:.

2. You need software to run TEX / LaTEX, download some.

3. Using RStudio opens the file: **Manuscript_github.Rmd**

4. Inside de code:

4.1 In setwd() type the project folder directory on your computer. Example: setwd("D:/User/ML-Project")

4.2 Install all libraries required for the project.

4.3 Run the project.

4.4 This procedure will generate a .pdf file in manuscript format.

Processing can take time, if you want to see our results, our methodology, references and the explanatory text open the file: **itathesis.pdf**.
